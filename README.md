### ABSTRACT
The City and Borough of Juneau has a goal to reach 80% renewable energy for heating and transportation sectors by 2045. Ductless heat pumps are one way to help reach this goal because they reduce heating costs for residential units and are fully renewable space heating appliances when combined with Juneau's hydropower grid. Our project, Thermalize Juneau 2021, focuses on the education, deployment, and analysis of DHPs within Juneau, Alaska. We are researching ways to make DHPs affordable as well as evaluate their efficiency in cold climates. To do so, we needed to have baseline data for energy usages so that we can compare post-retrofit data after one heating season. In this project, we established and analyzed the statistical time series analysis of baseline electrical consumption data.
